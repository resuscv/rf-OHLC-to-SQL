SQL - The SQL code is basic, very basic.  I'm teaching myself as I go along.

Robustness - The code is not very robust.  I need to build in more try() type commands.


Acknowlegement:

Some/parts/most(?) of the SQL interface code comes from the collection
of useful R snippets put up by Vincent Zoonekynd:
